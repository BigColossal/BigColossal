Hey.
I'm Jeremy Perez, a dedicated upcoming programmer.
I've always been an ambitious person striving to be the best of myself, and recently I found my new passion of coding.
My goals are to become a full-stack developer and probably start a buisness too.
I believe no goal is impossible, and I'm willing to put in the sweat and hard work to reach it.
